## Overview
This repo adds support for WebSockets over HTTP1 for swift-libp2p applications. WebSockets are realtime full-duplex streams over tcp. This module doesn't support WebSocket Secure (WSS) connections. Instead it encrypts traffic using a libp2p security module such as [Noise](https://github.com/swift-libp2p/swift-libp2p-noise.git).


## Install

Include the following dependency in your Package.swift file
``` swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-libp2p/swift-libp2p-websocket.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
    ],
        ...
        .target(
            ...
            dependencies: [
                ...
                .product(name: "LibP2PWebSocket", package: "swift-libp2p-websocket"),
            ]),
    ...
)
```

## Usage

### Example

import LibP2PWebSocket

/// Tell libp2p that it should listen for WS connections on the following ip:port...
app.servers.use( .ws(host: "127.0.0.1", port: 10000) )
/// Tell libp2p that it can dial peers using WebSockets `ws`
app.transports.use( .ws )

```
